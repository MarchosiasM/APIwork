# APIwork

An exercise in API calls using AJAX in the jquery framework, this app is a simple web-based interface that allows you to populate the page with gifs using your desired keyword. You can use any of the show-themed buttons provided, or input your own button which should populate based on your input (after that input is lightly validated).

# To use

Simply navigate to https://marchosiasm.github.io/APIwork/ and try it out! Either click on the provided topics, or type your own into the `Add Search Topic` button to create your own button and populate custom gifs from the GIPHY library.
